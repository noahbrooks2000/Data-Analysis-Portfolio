Hey, I'm Noah. I am an aspiring data analyst with an analytical background in Accounting and I am currently pursuing my bachelors degree in Computer Science from Western Governors University. Being good with numbers all my life, I am excited to make a career out of analyzing data in order to make data-driven decisions and help a company grow. 

I believe my background in Accounting further helps me in determining precisely the needs of a business and how important data is in determining such. In my free time I enjoy to dive deep into data analysis tools and techniques. I am always looking to improve and hone my skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
